    From http://www.sencha.com/legal/open-source-faq/open-source-license-exception-for-applications/ :


    Exception for Applications Version 1.04, January 18, 2013

    Exception Intent

    We want people to be able to build Free/Libre and Open Source Software (“FLOSS”) applications
    using Sencha SDKs despite the fact that not all FLOSS licenses are compatible with version 3.0 of
    the GNU General Public License (the “GPL”).

    This Exception is intended to be used for end-user applications and is not intended to be applied to
    software development libraries or toolkits, as per section 2(d) below. For development libraries,
    please refer to the Open Source License Exception for Development.

    Terms and Conditions

    Definitions

        - Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the meaning provided in the GPL.
        - “Library” means Ext JS, Sencha Touch or Sencha GXT, for which this exception is applicable.
        - “Derivative Work” means derivative works as defined by US copyright law.

    Additional Grants

    As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 3.0 of the GPL:

    You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed entirely from the Library and one or more
    works (each, a “FLOSS Work”) licensed under one or more of the licenses listed below in section 5,
    as long as:

        - You obey the GPL in all respects for the Library and the Derivative Work, except for identifiable
          sections of the Derivative Work which are not derived from the Library, and which can
          reasonably be considered independent and separate works in themselves
        - All identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are not derived from the Library, and which
          can reasonably be considered independent and separate works in themselves, are distributed
          subject to one of the FLOSS licenses listed below, and
        - The object code or executable form of those sections are accompanied by the complete
          corresponding machine-readable source code for those sections on the same medium and
          under the same FLOSS license as the corresponding object code or executable forms of those
          sections, and
        - Any works which are aggregated with the Library or with a Derivative Work on a volume of a
          storage or distribution medium in accordance with the GPL, can reasonably be considered
          independent and separate works in themselves which are not derivatives of either the Library, a
          Derivative Work or a FLOSS Work.
        - The Derivative Work can reasonably be considered independent and separate work that is
          intended for use by end-users and not as a library for software development purposes.

    Applicability

    This exception applies to Ext JS version 2.2 or later, Sencha Touch 1.0 or later and Sencha GXT
    version 1.0 or later released under the GPL that contain a conspicuous notice with the Derivative
    Work and conspicuously posted online near any download location, saying that Derivative Works
    built using the Library may be distributed under the terms of this Exception and that the included
    Library is subject to the terms of the GPL v3.

    This Exception can in no way be considered to grant rights to use or distribute the Library under any
    license other than the GPL v3.

    Termination

    If you fail to comply with any of the terms in this Exception then all rights granted to you herein are
    void and your rights immediately revert back to those granted in the GPL v3.

    Exception for Development Version 1.04, January 18, 2013

    Exception Intent

    We want people who build extensions, developer toolkits and frameworks, language packs and
    themes for Sencha frameworks and libraries to be able to publicly distribute them under less
    restrictive license terms, even though version 3 of the GNU General Public License (the “GPL”) may
    require them to be licensed under the GPL.

    This Exception does not grant usage or distribution of any Sencha development library under a
    license other than the GPL and cannot be applied to end-user applications. For applications, please
    refer to the Open Source License Exception for Applications.

    Terms and Conditions

    Definitions

        - “Code” means source code for the Library or Extension.
        - “Images” means images distributed with Code.
        - “Modification” means a visual change or enhancement made to a Library Component
          (“Component”) by means of modifying the standard functionality or visual appearance of the
          Component.

    *“Extension” means the combination of Code and Images to form a Modification or a completely new
    and original Component.

    Additional Grants

    As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 3.0 of the GPL:

    You are free to distribute an Extension licensed under one or more of the licenses listed below in
    section 5, as long as:

        - Your Extension does not contain any Code or modified Code from the Library.
        - You do not distribute the Library, as a whole or in part, with your Extension. Optionally, you
          should include instructions for developers using your Extension explaining how to obtain the
          Library.
        - You include PROMINENT notice in EVERY location you display the license information for your
          Extension that it uses the Library, that the Library is distributed under the terms of the GPL v3

    Eclipse Public License -v 1.0 (EPL 1.0)

    THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
    LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
    CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

    1. DEFINITIONS

    "Contribution" means:

    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
    distributed under this Agreement, and

    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

    i) changes to the Program, and

    ii) additions to the Program;

    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
    distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
    Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
    acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
    the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
    conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are
    not derivative works of the Program.

    "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

    "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
    necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
    combined with the Program.

    "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
    Agreement.

    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
    including all Contributors.

    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
    Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
    reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
    distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and
    such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
    Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
    Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
    transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
    object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the
    Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the
    Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
    covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
    other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
    licensed hereunder.

    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
    its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
    Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
    property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability
    to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
    intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
    rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
    responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
    For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
    distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that
    license before distributing the Program.

    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license
    set forth in this Agreement.

    3. REQUIREMENTS

    A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
    its own license agreement, provided that:

    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

    b) its license agreement:

    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
    conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title
    and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability
    and fitness for a particular purpose;

    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
    damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
    damages, such as lost profits;

    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
    that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,
    and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
    medium customarily used for software exchange.

    When the Program is made available in source code form:

    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

    Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
    Program.

    Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
    any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
    originator of the Contribution.

    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
    respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
    intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
    includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
    which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
    a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
    Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
    every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
    and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
    actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
    extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
    connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
    offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
    relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
    to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
    Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor
    to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and
    any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
    participate in any such claim at its own expense.

    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
    offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
    Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
    related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
    Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
    Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
    Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
    requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
    Contributor must pay those damages.

    5. NO WARRANTY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
    "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
    NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
    Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
    and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise
    of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and
    costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of
    data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
    CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
    SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
    STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY
    WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
    GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    7. GENERAL

    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
    law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
    terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
    provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
    provision valid and enforceable.

    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
    (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
    infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted
    under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
    comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
    not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
    such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
    Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
    reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
    and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
    and survive.

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
    order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
    modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
    publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
    No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
    The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation
    may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
    separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
    distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always
    be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
    Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)
    under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
    above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of
    any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under
    this Agreement are reserved.

    This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
    intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
    Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
    after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial
    in any resulting litigation.

        SOFTWARE RIGHTS

        ANTLR 1989-2006 Developed by Terence Parr
        Partially supported by University of San Francisco & jGuru.com

        We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the
        public domain. An individual or company may do whatever
        they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the
        code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of
        ANTLR, or its output, into commerical software.

        We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However,
        we do ask that credit is given to us for developing
        ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or
        incorporate any source code into one of your programs
        (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that
        you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation,
        research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have
        developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that
        you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the
        headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these
        guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this
        system and expect to make other tools available as they are
        completed.

        2. License Grants and Conditions
        --------------------------------

        2.1. Grants

        Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
        non-exclusive license:

        (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
            Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
            modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
            Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
            as part of a Larger Work; and

        (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
            for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
            Contributions or its Contributor Version.

        2.2. Effective Date

        The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
        become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
        distributes such Contribution.

        2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

        The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
        this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
        distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
        Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
        Contributor:

        (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
            or

        (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
            modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
            Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
            Version); or

        (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
            its Contributions.

        This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
        or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
        the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

        2.4. Subsequent Licenses

        No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
        distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
        License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
        permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

        2.5. Representation

        Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
        Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
        to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

        2.6. Fair Use

        This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
        applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
        equivalents.

        2.7. Conditions

        Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
        in Section 2.1.

        3. Responsibilities
        -------------------

        3.1. Distribution of Source Form

        All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
        Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
        the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
        Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
        License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
        attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
        Form.

        3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

        If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

        (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
            Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
            the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
            Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
            than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

        (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
            License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
            license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
            the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

        3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

        You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
        provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
        the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
        Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
        Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
        License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
        under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
        the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
        Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
        License(s).

        3.4. Notices

        You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
        (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
        or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
        the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
        the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

        3.5. Application of Additional Terms

        You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
        Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
        behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
        such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
        You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
        liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
        disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
        jurisdiction.

        4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
        ---------------------------------------------------

        If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
        License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
        statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
        the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
        describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
        be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
        Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
        or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
        recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

        5. Termination
        --------------

        5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
        if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
        compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
        Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
        Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
        ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
        non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
        come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
        Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
        notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
        first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
        from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
        Your receipt of the notice.

        5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
        infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
        counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
        directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
        You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
        2.1 of this License shall terminate.

        5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
        end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
        have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
        prior to termination shall survive termination.

        8. Litigation
        -------------

        Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
        courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
        place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
        jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
        Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
        cross-claims or counter-claims.

        9. Miscellaneous
        ----------------

        This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
        matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
        unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
        necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
        that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
        shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

        10. Versions of the License
        ---------------------------

        10.1. New Versions

        Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
        10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
        publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
        distinguishing version number.

        10.2. Effect of New Versions

        You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
        of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
        or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
        steward.

        10.3. Modified Versions

        If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
        create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
        modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
        any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
        such modified license differs from this License).

        10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
        Licenses

        If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
        Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
        notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

        If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular

        Work shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License,
        as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

        Derivative Works shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from)
        the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent,
        as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not
        include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

        Contribution shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any
        modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to

        but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright
        owner as Not a Contribution.

        Contributor shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been
        received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
           grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
           reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
           Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
           grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license
           to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license
           applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
           Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s)
           was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or
           counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
           direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for
           that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium,
           with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

            a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
            b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
            c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent,
               trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
               pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
            d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that
               You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file,
               excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
               following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the
               Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated
               by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the
               NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own
               attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
               NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
               modifying the License.

        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license
        terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative
        Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the
        conditions stated in this License.

        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
           for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,
           without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or
           modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such
           Contributions.

        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or
        product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of
        the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the
           Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
           OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
           NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
           determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with
           Your exercise of permissions under this License.

        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
           contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts)
           or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
           special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of
           the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
           computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
           Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof,
           You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
           obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations,
           You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,
           and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by,
           or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
           liability.

        License

        THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE").
        THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED
        UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

        BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS
        LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS
        AND CONDITIONS.

        1. Definitions

           1. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work
              in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and
              independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective
              Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
           2. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works,
              such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
              sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
              transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a
              Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
              composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
              ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
           3. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
           4. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
           5. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.
           6. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated
              the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor
              to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
           7. "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and
              indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.

        2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from
           fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or
           other applicable laws.

        3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide,
           royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the
           rights in the Work as stated below:

           1. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the
              Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
           2. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
           3. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by
              means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
           4. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by
              means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.
           5.For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:
                 1. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,
                    whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the
                    public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
                 2. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether
                    individually or via a music rights society or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency),
                    royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute,
                    subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act
                    (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
           6. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording,
              Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society
              (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the
              compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act
              (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

        The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised.
        The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the
        rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

        4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the
           following restrictions:

           1. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under
              the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,
              this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
              or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the
              terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense
              the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties.
              You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any
              technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of
              this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does
              not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.
              If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
              from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work,
              upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit
              as required by clause 4(c), as requested.
           2. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work
              only under the terms of this License, a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this
              License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license that contains the same License Elements as this License
              (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 Japan). You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,
              this License or other license specified in the previous sentence with every copy or phonorecord of each
              Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform.
              You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of this
              License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices
              that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display,
              publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological measures that
              control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement.
              The above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require
              the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.
           3. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any
              Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
              reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable)
              if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties
              (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice,
              terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work
              if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor
              specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
              licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of
              the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
              based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
              provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will
              appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such
              other comparable authorship credit.

        5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

        UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS
        OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
        WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT,
        OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
        DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT
        APPLY TO YOU.

        6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE
        LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
        ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
        SUCH DAMAGES.

        7. Termination

           1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
              terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from
              You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
              entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
              termination of this License.
           2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the
              applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
              Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any
              such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to
              be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless
              terminated as stated above.

        8. Miscellaneous

           1. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers
              to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
              this License.
           2. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient
              a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
              License.
           3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the
              validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
              parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
              provision valid and enforceable.
           4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver
              or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
           5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.
              There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here.
              Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You.
              This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

        Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work.
        Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever,
        including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection
        to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified
        itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

        Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither
        party will use the trademark "Creative Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without
        the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons'

         Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and (2) the
         combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
         Version (or portions of such combination).

         (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the
         date Contributor first distributes or otherwise makes the Modifications
         available to a third party.

         (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: (1)
         for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; (2)
         for infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications of Contributor
         Version, or (ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor
         with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other
         devices; or (3) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the
         absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

    3. Distribution Obligations.

    3.1. Availability of Source Code.

    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in
    Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source
    Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must
    include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the
    Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform
    recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
    obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
    through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

    3.2. Modifications.

    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the
    terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are
    Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights
    conveyed by this License.

    3.3. Required Notices.

    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as
    the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright,
    patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any
    notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
    Contributor or the Initial Developer.

    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code
    form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
    recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
    warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
    of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
    behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
    clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
    offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
    and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
    such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms
    You offer.

    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms
    of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may
    contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance
    with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does
    not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form
    from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
    Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it
    absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by
    You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to
    indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
    by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
    offer.

    3.6. Larger Works.

    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not
    governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single
    product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are
    fulfilled for the Covered Software.

    4. Versions of the License.

    4.1. New Versions.

    Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new
    versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a
    distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other
    than the license steward has the right to modify this License.

    4.2. Effect of New Versions.

    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
    Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You
    originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a
    notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or
    otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must
    distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
    version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
    Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
    Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
    published by the license steward.

    4.3. Modified Versions.

    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your
    Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if
    You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license
    steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b)
    otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
    License.

    5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

    COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT
    WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
    LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
    MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS
    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
    COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER
    OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
    CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
    LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
    THIS DISCLAIMER.

    6. TERMINATION.

    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
    if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30
    days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must
    remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
    actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or
    Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as “Participant”)
    alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
    the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant
    is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any
    and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the
    Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all
    Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
    notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
    expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You
    withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such
    Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
    Participant.

    6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that
    the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such
    claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of
    patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
    granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into
    account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

    6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user
    licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
    prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)
    shall survive termination.

    7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
    NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER
    CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF
    SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES
    FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND
    ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
    INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL
    NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S
    NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME
    JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

    The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48
    C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that
    term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer
    software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
    Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
    (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only
    those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of,
    and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
    Government rights in computer software under this License.

    9. MISCELLANEOUS.

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.
    If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision
    shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This
    License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
    contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if
    any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
    provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
    jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a
    notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible
    for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'
    fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
    for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
    which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
    drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are
    responsible for compliance with the United States export administration
    regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries)
    when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

    10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for
    claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of
    rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
    Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
    herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

    NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE
    (CDDL)

    The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of
    California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to
    this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
    Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California,
    with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.

                Larger Work; and

            (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or

                alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version
                (or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell,

            (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
                effective on the date Contributor first distributes or
                otherwise makes the Modifications available to a third
                party.

            (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
                granted: (1) for any code that Contributor has deleted
                from the Contributor Version; (2) for infringements caused
                by: (i) third party modifications of Contributor Version,
                or (ii) the combination of Modifications made by that
                Contributor with other software (except as part of the
                Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3) under Patent
                Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
                Modifications made by that Contributor.

    3. Distribution Obligations.

        3.1. Availability of Source Code.

        Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make
        available in Executable form must also be made available in Source
        Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under
        the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this
        License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered
        Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must
        inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form
        as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code
        form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
        used for software exchange.

        3.2. Modifications.

        The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
        governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You
        believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or
        You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
        License.

        3.3. Required Notices.

        You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
        identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may
        not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices
        contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing
        or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or
        the Initial Developer.

        3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

        You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
        Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version
        of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may
        choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
        Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,
        and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
        You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
        hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
        Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
        such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
        liability terms You offer.

        3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

        You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software
        under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of
        Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
        provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
        and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
        limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
        the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the
        Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You
        must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
        this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
        Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
        Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
        by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
        such terms You offer.

        3.6. Larger Works.

        You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
        other code not governed by the terms of this License and
        distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,
        You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled
        for the Covered Software.

    4. Versions of the License.

        4.1. New Versions.

        Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may
        publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to
        time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
        Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license
        steward has the right to modify this License.

        4.2. Effect of New Versions.

        You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
        Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
        License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
        If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original
        Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made
        available under any subsequent version of the License, You must
        distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms
        of the version of the License under which You originally received
        the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use,
        distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under
        the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
        the license steward.

        4.3. Modified Versions.

        When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
        license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
        modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license
        and remove any references to the name of the license steward
        (except to note that the license differs from this License); and
        (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which
        differ from this License.

    5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

        COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS"
        BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
        INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
        SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
        PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
        COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
        INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
        NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
        WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
        ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
        DISCLAIMER.

    6. TERMINATION.

        6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
        automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
        cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
        Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond
        the termination of this License shall survive.

        6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
        declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
        Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
        assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that
        the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
        the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where
        the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
        infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
        indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if
        the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors
        under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
        notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically
        at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
        such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
        Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally
        or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

        6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
        all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
        distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
        granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

    7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

        UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
        (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
        INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
        COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
        LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
        LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
        STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
        COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
        INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
        LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
        INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
        APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
        NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
        APPLY TO YOU.

    8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

        The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is
        defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial
        computer software" (as that term is defined at 48
        C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software
        documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
        (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
        C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
        U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those
        rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in
        lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or
        provision that addresses Government rights in computer software
        under this License.

    9. MISCELLANEOUS.

        This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
        matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
        unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
        necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed
        by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained
        within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law,
        if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's
        conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
        License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located
        in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained
        within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible
        for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and
        reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the
        United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
        of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which
        provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
        against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree
        that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
        States export administration regulations (and the export control
        laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
        distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

    10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

        As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
        responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
        indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
        and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
        distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
        herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
        of liability.

         2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.
         The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
         non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
         claims:
              (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
              trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
              modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
              Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or
              as part of a Larger Work; and

              infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
              that Contributor.

    3. Distribution Obligations.

         3.1. Application of License.
         The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
         governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
         Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
         distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
         of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
         copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
         distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
         version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
         License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
         an additional document offering the additional rights described in
         Section 3.5.

         3.2. Availability of Source Code.
         Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
         made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
         either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
         Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
         Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
         Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
         months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
         (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
         has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
         ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
         Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

         3.3. Description of Modifications.
         You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
         file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
         the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
         the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
         Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
         Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
         Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
         origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

         3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
              (a) Third Party Claims.
              If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
              intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
              granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
              Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
              distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
              party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
              know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
              the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
              Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
              Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
              (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
              reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
              Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

              (b) Contributor APIs.
              If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
              interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
              are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
              also include this information in the LEGAL file.

                   (c)    Representations.
              Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
              Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
              Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
              Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
              this License.

         3.5. Required Notices.
         You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
         Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
         Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
         location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
         to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
         You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
         Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
         for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
         rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
         charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
         obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
         may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
         Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
         any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
         offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
         Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
         Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
         support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

         3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
         You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
         requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
         and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
         the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
         including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
         obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
         in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
         collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
         Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
         Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
         contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
         compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
         Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
         rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
         License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
         license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
         from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
         Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
         Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
         the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
         terms You offer.

         3.7. Larger Works.
         You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
         not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
         Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
         requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

         If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
         License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
         statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
         the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
         describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
         must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
         be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
         extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
         sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
         understand it.

    5. Application of this License.

         This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
         attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

    6. Versions of the License.

         6.1. New Versions.
         Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
         and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
         will be given a distinguishing version number.

         6.2. Effect of New Versions.
         Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
         License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
         version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
         of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
         other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
         Covered Code created under this License.

         6.3. Derivative Works.
         If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
         only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
         governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
         the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
         "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
         license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
         and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
         contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
         Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
         Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
         Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
         this License.)

    7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

         COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
         WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
         DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
         THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
         IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
         YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
         COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
         OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
         ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

    8. TERMINATION.

         8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
         automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
         such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
         sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
         survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
         nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
         shall survive.

         8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
         claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
         or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
         You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

         (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
         infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
         Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
         shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
         unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
         agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
         royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
         Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
         the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
         of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
         mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
         is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
         Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
         the 60 day notice period specified above.

         (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
         Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
         any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
         and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
         sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
         Participant.

         8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
         alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
         indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
         by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
         infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
         granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
         into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
         license.

         8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
         all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
         which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
         prior to termination shall survive termination.

    9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

         UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
         (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
         DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
         OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
         ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
         CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
         WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
         COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
         INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
         LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
         RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
         PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
         EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
         THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

         The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
         48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
         software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
         terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
         C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
         all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
         rights set forth herein.

    11. MISCELLANEOUS.

         This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
         matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
         unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
         necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
         California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
         any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
         With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
         or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
         States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
         subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
         District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
         California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
         without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
         expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
         Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
         Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
         shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
         License.

    12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

         As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
         responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
         out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
         work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
         responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
         shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

    13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

         Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
         "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
         Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
         Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
         by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

    Common Public License - v 1.0 (CPL 1.0)

    THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON
    PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
    OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

    1. DEFINITIONS

    "Contribution" means:

    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
       documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

       i)  changes to the Program, and

       ii) additions to the Program;

       where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
       and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
       'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
       such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
       Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are
       separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the
       Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative
       works of the Program.

    "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

    "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
    or when combined with the Program.

    "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
    Agreement.

    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
    including all Contributors.

    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license
       to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
       perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
       Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
       object code form.

    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
       Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and
       otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in
       source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to
       the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time
       the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
       Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed
       Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
       which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed
       hereunder.

    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
       licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
       provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
       patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
       Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
       brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
       property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights
       and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
       responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
       needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is
       required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is
       Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
       distributing the Program.

    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
       copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
       license set forth in this Agreement.

    3. REQUIREMENTS

    A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
    under its own license agreement, provided that:

    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

    b) its license agreement:

       i)   effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
            and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
            conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties
            or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular
            purpose;

       ii)  effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
            for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
            consequential damages, such as lost profits;

       iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
            offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

       iv)  states that source code for the Program is available from such
            Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
            reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for
            software exchange.

    When the Program is made available in source code form:

    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
       the Program.

    Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
    within the Program.

    Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
    Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
    Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering
    should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for
    other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program
    in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial
    Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other
    Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
    and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and
    other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
    Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this
    section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual
    or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify,
    an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
    Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
    Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor
    in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified
    Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
    performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
    Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
    must pay those damages.

    5. NO WARRANTY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED
    ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
    CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR
    A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for
    determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program
    and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this
    Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program
    errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
    programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
    ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
    INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
    WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
    LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
    NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
    DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
    HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    7. GENERAL

    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
    respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
    counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
    Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of
    the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes
    patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or
    counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding
    combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes
    such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
    Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails
    to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement
    and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after
    becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under
    this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution
    of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
    obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient
    relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may
    only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves
    the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement
    from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right
    to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may
    assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
    separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
    distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may
    always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which
    it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is
    published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including
    its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in
    Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses
    to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,
    whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in
    the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

    This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
    intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to
    this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than
    one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights
    to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.
